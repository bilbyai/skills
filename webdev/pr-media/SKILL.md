# Images and videos in PRs and issues

`gh` (≥ 2.103) uploads them itself. `gh pr create|edit|comment` and `gh issue create|edit|comment` take
`--attach './file.png#alt text'`; repeat the flag for several files (max 50 per command).
Place them by referencing `![alt](./file.png)` in the `--body-file`; unreferenced ones are appended.

- **Write access to the repo:** always use `--attach`. Don't use agent-browser or ask anyone to upload by hand.
- **No write access** (e.g. a fork PR against someone else's repo, which fails with "attaching files requires write access"):
  the CLI can't upload, so add the images on the web, in the PR's comment box, with a logged-in browser: agent-browser via CDP, or whichever browser the author has set up for agents (MCP or CLI).
  If you don't know which one to use, ask the author.
  If the author doesn't want that, save the images in `/tmp` and hand the paths to the PR author to drop in themselves. That is the last resort.
- Never use throwaway branches or commits to host images.
